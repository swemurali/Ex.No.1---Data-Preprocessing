# Ex.No.1---Data-Preprocessing
## AIM:

### To perform Data preprocessing in a data set downloaded from Kaggle

## REQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
### Hardware – PCs
### Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Google Colab /Jupiter Notebook

## RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPT:

### Kaggle :
#### Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

### Data Preprocessing:

#### Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm. Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.
#### Data Preprocessing is the process of making data suitable for use while training a machine learning model. The dataset initially provided for training might not be in a ready-to-use state, for e.g. it might not be formatted properly, or may contain missing or null values.Solving all these problems using various methods is called Data Preprocessing, using a properly processed dataset while training will not only make life easier for you but also increase the efficiency and accuracy of your model.

### Need of Data Preprocessing :

#### For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner. Some specified Machine Learning model needs information in a specified format, for example, Random Forest algorithm does not support null values, therefore to execute random forest algorithm null values have to be managed from the original raw data set.
#### Another aspect is that the data set should be formatted in such a way that more than one Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithm are executed in one data set, and best out of them is chosen.


## ALGORITHM:
### 1. Importing the libraries
### 2. Importing the dataset
### 3. Taking care of missing data
### 4. Encoding categorical data
### 5. Normalizing the data
### 6. Splitting the data into test and train

#Detect the Outliers
# Outliers are any abnormal values going beyond

""" Normalize the data - There are range of values in different columns of x are different. 

To get a correct ne plot the data of x between 0 and 1 

LabelEncoder can be used to normalize labels.
It can also be used to transform non-numerical labels to numerical labels.

'''
MinMaxScaler - Transform features by scaling each feature to a given range. 
When we normalize the dataset it brings the value of all the features between 0 and 1 so that all the columns are in the same range, and thus there is no dominant feature.'''

df1

df1.describe()

# Since values like Row Number, Customer Id and surname  doesn't affect the output y(Exited).
#So those are not considered in the x values
X = df1[["CreditScore","Geography","Gender","Age","Tenure","Balance","NumOfProducts","HasCrCard","IsActiveMember","EstimatedSalary"]].values
